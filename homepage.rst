About
=====

Hello and welcome to my home page. I am currently a PhD student at the 
`Graduate Program in Computer Science <http://dcc.ufmg.br>`_ from the
`Federal University of Minas Gerais <http://ufmg.br>`_. My advisor is Prof. 
Jussara Marques de Almeida.

My research interests are:

    * Social media
    * Online user behavior
    * Data mining
    * Information retrieval

In the past I have worked with:

    * Grid computing (`Ourgrid <http://ourgrid.org>`_)
    * P2P computing
    * Business driven IT management

These previous projects were mostly done at the `Federal University of Campina
Grande <http://ufcg.edu.br>`_, where I did my `BSc in Computer Science
<http://computacao.ufcg.edu.br>`_, and was a member of the `Distributed
Systems Laboratory <http://lsd.ufcg.edu.br>`_.

Around the web you can find me on `Github <http://github.com/flaviovdf>`_.
